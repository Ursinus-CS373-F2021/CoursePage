* Define formal descriptions of DFAs (Q, Sigma, delta, q, F) [10 minutes]

Exercise: Draw a DFA from a description [5 minutes]


* Talk about what a regular language is [10 minutes]
Connect to the definition with existence of sequence of states r0, r1, ..., rn in Q so that
1. r0 = q0
2. detla(ri, wi+1) = ri+1
3. rn in F

* Group Exercise: Define a DFA formally that accepts binary strings with at most K ones [15 minutes]

* Exercise: Show that given a language, its reverse is a regular language [10 minutes]
